Age and Gender Prediction
This project is an age and gender prediction tool that uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and a pre-trained model to estimate age and gender based on detected faces. Currently, the project leverages Caffe-based deep learning models for age and gender classification, and OpenCV for image processing and face detection.

Features
Face Detection: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in an image.
Age Prediction: Predicts the age group of each detected face using a pre-trained age prediction model.
Gender Prediction: Determines the gender (male or female) of each detected face.
Confidence Filtering: Only displays predictions for age and gender if the model's confidence is above a certain threshold to improve reliability.

Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd AgeGender
Ensure you have Python 3 and the necessary packages installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy opencv-python opencv-python-headless
Download the required Caffe models and prototxt files:

age_net.caffemodel
age_deploy.prototxt
gender_net.caffemodel
gender_deploy.prototxt
Place these files in the project directory.
Usage
Place an image file in the project directory or specify the path in the script.

Run the script to detect faces and predict age and gender:

bash
Copy code
python AgeGender.py
The output will show the image with bounding boxes around detected faces, labeled with the predicted age group and gender if the confidence threshold is met.

Example

In this example, the script detects faces in an image, and labels each face with the predicted gender and age group.

Future Improvements
Advanced deep learning models will be used in future updates for improving age and gender predictions. These advanced models have to be fine-tuned on a larger and more diversified dataset that would provide higher accuracy in the fine-tuning of predictions across different age ranges and demographic groups. This approach would mean training or transferring learning on a new deep learning model that can handle more complex variations in lighting, angle, and facial expressions.
